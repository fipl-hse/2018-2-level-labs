Yesterday,
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they are here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly,
I'm not half the man I used to be
There is a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I do not know,
She would not say
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I do not know,
She would not say
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
